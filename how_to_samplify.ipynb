    "The array `C`, for \"chains,\" has all the numbers you need to define the planet models. Its shape is `w`, number of \"walkers\", by `n`, number of steps, by `d`, number of dimensions. For example this file is the output of a `drive-ppbs.py` run. The ppbs parameerization has 8 dimensions (plus potentially rotation period, which in this run was kept constant). This was a run of 160 walkers, taking 4400 steps each. A vector of parameters for one planet will be something like, say, `C[2,24,:]`, meaning the 25th step of the third walker. The walkers are a feature of the so-called \"ensemble\" MCMC algorithm. We need the walker-by-walker data only to diagnose sampling problems and figure out auto-correlation distance. Afterwards we will forget about walkers and end up with an array of something-by-8, of (hopefully) independent samples.\n",

    "The array `L`, for \"likelihood,\" has the likelihood values for each step of each walker. This is sometimes needed for debugging and diagnosing issues, or for detecting outliers."
