* modify save_ppwd_winners to discard seeds pretending to be winners
* get saturn J4_obs0 sample with varying rotation (how?)
* rename saturn samples to include rotation state in scheme
* add saturn observables with 0.1e-6 J246 uncertainty; make samples
* keep trying to match J6 to full obs0 precision (RUNNING ON NEFELE)
