* import losses in setws
* modify save_ppwd_winners to discard seeds pretending to be winners
* modify saturn observables rotation uncertainty to 55 sec
* get saturn J4_obs0 sample with varying rotation (how?)
* rename saturn samples to include rotation state in scheme
* add saturn observables with 0.1e-6 J246 uncertainty; make samples
* keep trying to match J6 to full obs0 precision; check how close is the
  closest one from J4_obs0 sample
