The samples in this folder use the ppwd density profile parameterization with
*rotation preserving* gravity solution. The rotation period is either fixed
(PF) or varying with a prior (PV), in which case the first value in the sample
parameter vector x is the standard-normalized rotation period. In all samples
the mass and equatorial radius are fixed at their reference values and the
implied 1-bar density is part of the likelihood. The chi2 dof are then the
number of J values considered plus 2. The sample file naming scheme is

`<poly_deg>_<toforder>_<J_max>_<obsnum>_<PV/PF>.txt`

This sampling results in very different models than those generated by the
hierarchical sampling of piecewise-quadratic and quartic top we used in 2019,
and I am still trying to understand why.
